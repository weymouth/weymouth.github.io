  "body": "I'm an Associate Professor in the University of Southampton and I do research in computational fluid dynamics with the Ship Science group, and I'm part of the Southampton Marine and Maritime Institute. I use github to host a few of my interactive fluid simulators and teaching-related code. \r\n\r\n## [Lily Pad](https://github.com/weymouth/lily-pad)\r\n\r\nLily Pad is an interactive viscous flow solver which has been used to produce results for top-tier academic journals as well as demonstrate basic flow concept in classrooms and on TV. \r\n\r\n## [Marine Hydrodynamics](https://github.com/weymouth/MarineHydro)\r\n\r\nMarine Hydrodynamics is a third-year course I teach at the University of Southampton covering viscous flow, potential flow and numerical methods. Github holds a set of Jupyter notebooks used primarily in the numerical portion of the course.\r\n\r\n## [Interactive web-apps](https://github.com/weymouth/fluid-dynamics)\r\nI have a set of web-apps and [Android apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=processing.test.pflow3) that I use to illustrate fluid dynamic concepts in undergraduate teaching and outreach.",
